# dataviz_ggplot2_themes

Workshop description:
Tired of ggplot2â€™s default colour palette and grey background? Want to change the typeface of your text? Wondering how to spice up your legend? While ggplot2 is undoubtedly one of the best packages
to visualise data, we seldom make the most out of its themes and customisation
options. Using different themes can help improve the aesthetics of our figures
and add visual interest to our audience. In this workshop, you will learn how
to create and apply your own customised themes to your figures.
